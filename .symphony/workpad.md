# BIG-GO-1383 Workpad

## Plan

1. Reconfirm the repository-wide physical Python asset inventory, with explicit checks for `src/bigclaw`, `tests`, `scripts`, and `bigclaw-go/scripts`.
2. Land lane-scoped reporting and regression coverage that document the remaining inventory and pin the active Go/native replacement paths.
3. Run targeted validation, capture exact commands and results in lane artifacts, then commit and push the branch.

## Acceptance

- The lane records the remaining Python asset inventory for the repository and the priority residual directories.
- The lane either removes physical Python files or, if none remain in-branch, documents the zero-Python baseline and keeps the sweep scoped to regression prevention.
- The lane names the current Go/native replacement paths for the retired Python surface.
- Exact validation commands and outcomes are recorded.
- The change is committed and pushed to the remote branch.

## Validation

- `find . -path '*/.git' -prune -o -name '*.py' -type f -print | sort`
- `find src/bigclaw tests scripts bigclaw-go/scripts -type f -name '*.py' 2>/dev/null | sort`
- `cd /Users/openagi/code/bigclaw-workspaces/BIG-GO-1383/bigclaw-go && go test -count=1 ./internal/regression -run 'TestBIGGO1383(RepositoryHasNoPythonFiles|PriorityResidualDirectoriesStayPythonFree|GoReplacementPathsRemainAvailable|LaneReportCapturesSweepState)$'`
